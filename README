This is a driver for Advantech MIOe-3680 and possibly some other 1-4
port PCI CAN cards by Advantech.

It has been compiled and tested on openSUSE 13.1 for Linux kernel
3.11. It also compiles with up to kernel 4.2. To compile you need the
kernel-source package installed (not just kernel-devel) since this
depends on kernel internal sja1000.h header to compile.

If everything is properly installed, it should compile and install for
running kernel in two commands:

	$ make
	$ sudo make modules_install

When a kernel update is installed, you may need to recompile and
install manually.

I had planned to put it in openSUSE build service, but did not have
time. These links may be useful for that task:
