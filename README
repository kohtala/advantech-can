This is a driver for Advantech MIOe-3680 and possibly some other 1-4
port PCI CAN cards by Advantech.

It has been compiled on openSUSE 13.1 for Linux kernel 3.11. To
compile you need the kernel-source package installed (not just
kernel-devel) since this depends on kernel internal sja1000.h header
to compile.

If everything is properly installed, it should compile and install for
running kernel in two commands:

	$ make
	$ sudo make modules_install

When a kernel update is installed, you may need to recompile and
install manually.

I had planned to put it in openSUSE build service, but did not have
time. These links may be useful for that task:
